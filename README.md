# Suraj's Polls Project

This is my final project for Udacity's React Nanodegree.

## Usage

To begin, clone the repo, cd into the repo directory, and run `npm install`, and then `npm start`.

You can log in with any user info from the \_DATA.js file (for example, user "sarahedo" has password "password123".)

## Testing

Run `npm test` to run the Jest tests.
